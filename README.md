# Camera focus tool
Tool to help when focusing camera lenses

Calculates the Laplacian variance for the image and the specified ROIs. Higher variance = better focus.

## Usage
1. Use rqt_reconfigure to shift the ROIs over a siemens star.
2. Open rqt plot and add the variance topics
3. Adjust the lens to increase the variance
